# Frontend Mentor - Devjobs web app solution

This is a solution to the [Devjobs web app challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/devjobs-web-app-HuvC_LP4l). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## About the Project

The "Devjobs Web App" is a challenge from Frontend Mentor aimed at creating a job listing platform for developers.

This project was built using Next.js 14 Pages Router, focusing on static site generation for deployment on GitHub Pages.

It combines React for component-based development and Scss for styling, offering a dark/light theme toggle for user preference.

Users can browse through a list of job offer cards, filter them by job title, location, and whether they are full-time positions. Each job listing has its own statically generated page, providing detailed information about the job offer.
